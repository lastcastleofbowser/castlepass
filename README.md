# CastlePass â›« 

<i>A Fortress for your Passwords</i>


Password generator and manager. My final project submission for Harvard's CS50x Course

# Description
With today's society spending more time online, it is important to protect ourselves from risks in the digital space. One of the most effective ways to do this is to use strong, unique passwords for your separate accounts. Reusing passwords across multiple accounts is bad practice and can lead to your data and sensitive information being compromised. Likewise, weak, guessable passwords can easily allow people access into your account, which puts you at significant risk.

To help solve this problem I decided to create CastlePass, a fortress for your passwords!

CastlePass stores all your passwords in one place, securely. It can generate customised passwords and allows users to view, edit and delete their passwords all in one place. Generated passwords must be a minimum of 6 characters and can include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.
